## Introduction

We propose MasaCtrl, a tuning-free method for non-rigid consistent image synthesis and editing. The key idea is to combine the `contents` from the *source image* and the `layout` synthesized from *text prompt and additional controls* into the desired synthesized or edited image, by querying semantically correlated features with **Mutual Self-Attention Control**.


## Main Features

### 1 Consistent Image Synthesis and Editing

MasaCtrl can perform prompt-based image synthesis and editing that changes the layout while maintaining contents of source image.

>*The target layout is synthesized directly from the target prompt.*

</details>



### 2 Integration to Controllable Diffusion Models

Directly modifying the text prompts often cannot generate target layout of desired image, thus we further integrate our method into existing proposed controllable diffusion pipelines (like T2I-Adapter and ControlNet) to obtain stable synthesis and editing results.

>*The target layout controlled by additional guidance.*

### 3 Generalization to Other Models: Anything-V4

Our method also generalize well to other Stable-Diffusion-based models.

### 4 Extension to Video Synthesis

With dense consistent guidance, MasaCtrl enables video synthesis

## Usage

### Requirements
We implement our method with [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) code base with similar code structure to [Prompt-to-Prompt](https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt). The code runs on Python 3.8.5 with Pytorch 1.11. Conda environment is highly recommended.

```base
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Checkpoints

**Stable Diffusion:**
We mainly conduct expriemnts on Stable Diffusion v1-4, while our method can generalize to other versions (like v1-5). You can download these checkpoints on their official repository and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

**Personalized Models:**
You can download personlized models from [CIVITAI](https://civitai.com/) or train your own customized models.


### Demos

**Notebook demos**

To run the synthesis with MasaCtrl, single GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM is required. 

The notebook `playground.ipynb` and `playground_real.ipynb` provide the synthesis and real editing samples, respectively.

**Online demos**

We provide [![demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-Hugging%20Face-brightgreen)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TencentARC/MasaCtrl) with Gradio app. Note that you may copy the demo into your own space to use the GPU. Online Colab demo [![demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-Colab-brightgreen)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DZeQn2WvRBsNg4feS1bJrwWnIzw1zLJq?usp=sharing) is also available. 

**Local Gradio demo**

You can launch the provided Gradio demo locally with

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python app.py
```


### MasaCtrl with T2I-Adapter

Install [T2I-Adapter](https://github.com/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter) and prepare the checkpoints following their provided tutorial. Assuming it has been successfully installed and the root directory is `T2I-Adapter`. 

Thereafter copy the core `masactrl` package and the inference code `masactrl_w_adapter.py` to the root directory of T2I-Adapter

```bash
cp -r MasaCtrl/masactrl T2I-Adapter/
cp MasaCtrl/masactrl_w_adapter/masactrl_w_adapter.py T2I-Adapter/
```

**[Updates]** Or you can clone the repo [MasaCtrl-w-T2I-Adapter](https://github.com/ljzycmd/T2I-Adapter-w-MasaCtrl) directly to your local space.

Last, you can inference the images with following command (with sketch adapter)

```bash
python masactrl_w_adapter.py \
--which_cond sketch \
--cond_path_src SOURCE_CONDITION_PATH \
--cond_path CONDITION_PATH \
--cond_inp_type sketch \
--prompt_src "A bear walking in the forest" \
--prompt "A bear standing in the forest" \
--sd_ckpt models/sd-v1-4.ckpt \
--resize_short_edge 512 \
--cond_tau 1.0 \
--cond_weight 1.0 \
--n_samples 1 \
--adapter_ckpt models/t2iadapter_sketch_sd14v1.pth
```

NOTE: You can download the sketch examples [here](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/MasaCtrl/tree/main/sketch_example).

For real image, the DDIM inversion is performed to invert the image into the noise map, thus we add the inversion process into the original DDIM sampler. **You should replace the original file `T2I-Adapter/ldm/models/diffusion/ddim.py` with the exteneded version `MasaCtrl/masactrl_w_adapter/ddim.py` to enable the inversion function**. Then you can edit the real image with following command (with sketch adapter)

```bash
python masactrl_w_adapter.py \
--src_img_path SOURCE_IMAGE_PATH \
--cond_path CONDITION_PATH \
--cond_inp_type image \
--prompt_src "" \
--prompt "a photo of a man wearing black t-shirt, giving a thumbs up" \
--sd_ckpt models/sd-v1-4.ckpt \
--resize_short_edge 512 \
--cond_tau 1.0 \
--cond_weight 1.0 \
--n_samples 1 \
--which_cond sketch \
--adapter_ckpt models/t2iadapter_sketch_sd14v1.pth \
--outdir ./workdir/masactrl_w_adapter_inversion/black-shirt
```

NOTE: You can download the real image editing example [here](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/MasaCtrl/tree/main/black_shirt_example).
